# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm spo0nman

I spend most of my time thinking about how to make complex systems more reliable, observable, and easier to work with. My background is in building infrastructure, debugging hard problems, and quietly helping teams ship better software.

These days, I'm building [Calmo](https://getcalmo.com) â€” an AI assistant that helps engineers get to the root of production issues faster. It's like having a calm teammate who reads logs, metrics, and traces so you donâ€™t have to dig through five dashboards when things break.

## ðŸ”§ What I enjoy working on

- Distributed systems and observability
- Incident response and postmortem tooling
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and embeddings for dev workflows
- Graph-based knowledge systems
- Infrastructure automation (Kubernetes, Terraform, GCP)
- Making machines feel more human

## ðŸ§  Projects & Contributions

- **Calmo** â€” AI-powered incident management agent for SREs
- **MCP (Mastra Control Plane)** â€” Plugin-based server for AI agents with context switching
- **puppet-redis** â€” Contributed to multi-instance support for Redis on a single host
- **HostDB** â€” Data center inventory management tool
- **Bosun** â€” Time series alerting framework

If you're working on tools that help engineers do less busywork and more thinking, I'd love to chat. Especially if you're into incident response, AI tooling, or just want to talk about systems design.
